This is my final project for my data management and data science course. 
I'm very passionate about playing a game called yugioh so I designed A tool to help me analyze data I put in a spreadsheet. 
This is to help me figure out which deck and cards I can play to give me the biggest advantage possible. 
If you want to use this yourself, makes sure to follow the csv format deck1, result of the match, deck2, dice roll
